===Sharing network connection===
==== RPI /etc/dhcpcd.conf ====
Set RPI static ip eth0 to 192.168.137.10 --> 192.168.137... because windows forces this ip when bridging connections
This will be the ip used to connect through ssh
set RPI static ip wlan to 192.168.137.200
==== Windows network adaptors ====
set LAN adaptor to 192.168.137.1
set wireless connection to shared with LAN
==== RPI PING ====
fix "not permitted operation" with sudo chmod u+s /bin/ping
